# Sticky-Notes-App
we learn how to create a Notes App Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this Notes App, you can add new Notes, Edit Notes and Delete it.

In this note app, users can easily add, edit, or delete their notes. The notes user has added to this app will be stored in the browser’s local storage so, they won’t remove on page refresh or tab close, and it is done with pure JavaScript.
